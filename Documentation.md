## Remove Windows AI Documentation

### OS Support

- The script is created for any version of Windows 10 and Windows 11, Latest Stable Builds
- For best results use a Pro, Enterprise, Server, or Education version. I can not guarentee 100% removal on Home versions
  - If you are on a Home version and want to convert to pro I recommend using massgrave: https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts

### Code Review

- Given that Microsoft REALLY do not want users removing all AI features the script uses some advanced techniques in PowerShell

#### Run-Trusted Function

- This function leverages an exploit allowing code execution under the `TrustedInstaller.exe` service also known as `Windows Module Installer`
  - Various PowerShell commands will be ran hidden from the user allowing the script to remove items and packages that are locked via System Privileges
 
#### Registry Keys
- I have collected all registry keys regarding AI disablement, including Notepad, Paint, and Edge.
  - Some of these are Group Policies so if you see any AI feature settings greyed out with the message `Some Settings are Managed by Your Organization` this is why
 
#### Prevent Reinstall of AI Packages
- This option will install a custom Windows Update package to make Windows think that there is already a newer version of the AI package installed.
- Method from Atlas and Revi OS as they make use of these

#### Disable Copilot In IntegratedServicesRegionPolicySet
- This json file contains rules for deciding weither or not certain apps and settings are enabled based on your region
  - This is mainly used for the EEA [European Economic Area]
- The script finds all policies related to Copilot and sets the default state to disabled 


#### Appx Package Removal
- While the main Copilot package can be removed without any special tricks (Remove-AppxPackage) most AI packages are marked as `Non-Removeable` therefore, the script needs to use multiple exploits to remove these
 - The script creates a sub script in `%TEMP%` to be ran under the above mentioned function `Run-Trusted`
   - **Exploits Performed**
     
     - **End of Life**: one way to trick Windows into thinking a locked package can be removed is to add its Package Family Name to `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Appx\AppxAllUserStore\EndOfLife\USERSID`
       - To avoid Windows Update from failing these registry entries are removed once the package is confirmed uninstalled
     - **Deprovisioning**: this adds the Package Family Name to `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Appx\AppxAllUserStore\Deprovisioned` this will prevent the package from being reinstalled by Windows Update
     - **Set-NonRemovableAppsPolicy**: this dism command will attempt to remove the `Non-Removeable` property mentioned above and needs to have system privileges to work
     - **Removing Inbox Apps**: some packages are marked as `InboxApps` this prevents the user from removing them however, when the package is removed from the `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Appx\AppxAllUserStore\InboxApplications` via Run-Trusted Windows will no longer recognize it as an Inbox App

#### Recall Optional Feature
- On most systems recall will be installed via an optional feature, the script will disable and remove this resulting in the State of: `DisabledWithPayloadRemoved`

#### Hidden AI CBS Packages
- Windows CBS [Component-Based Servicing] contains windows packages where some can be visible and removable via `get-windowspackage` and `remove-windowspackage` respectfully
  - Most packages are not visible to the dism command by default so a few tricks are needed to enable this and allow for removal
- The script will search for packages containing various AI keywords in `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\Packages`
  - To enable visualzation and allow for removal the `Visibility` key needs to be set to 1 and the subkeys `Owners` and `Updates` need to be removed
 
#### Removing AI Files and Folders
- The script will forcibly remove the Appx package install locations, remove Machine Learning Dlls, and hidden Copilot installers.
- Additionally, various other reg keys and files are removed to ensure a proper cleanup of AI features

#### Disable Rewrite In Notepad
- There is two methods of doing this, the first way is loading the settings.dat file from notepads appdata directory into registry and setting the `RewriteEnabled` key to false
- Later on Microsoft added a much simpler policy to disable this, the script does both methods to be sure its disabled 

#### Remove Recall Scheduled Task
- This will create another sub script in `%TEMP%` in order to run with system privileges
  - The script will agressively remove Recall's scheduled tasks by removing the files as well as the registry entries
